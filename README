# Dotfiles

## Bootstrapping a new machine
Apart from being a repository for dotfiles, this also includes a boostrap script to run on new machines. The script does a bunch of preparation work which othewise would have been manual and also installs the tools required to use these dotfiles.

Run the `bootstrap` script.

## Linking the dotfiles

Run the `link` script.
